 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The Nabto Client API
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The Nabto client API exposes Nabto functionality that enables you to
 * access any Nabto enabled device on the Internet. You incorporate the
 * Nabto client API in your own Nabto client applications or your own
 * plug-ins for other client software such as web browsers.
 *
 * The Nabto client API is divided into five major parts.
 *
 *  1.   The session API.
 *  2.   The RPC API.
 *  3.   The streaming API.
 *  4.   The tunnel API.
 *  5.   The profile management API.
 *
 *  The Session API is typically the first you will use to prepare a
 *  session context with a user profile for further API invocation.
 *
 *  The RPC API is a set of functions that enables you to invoke
 *  functions on a remote Nabto enabled device.
 *
 *  The streaming API is a set of functions that enables you to make a
 *  permanent connection to a Nabto enabled device (assuming you have the
 *  right credentials). You will be able to read and write data from and to
 *  the device through the connection (Nabto stream).
 *
 *  The tunnel API is a set of functions that enables you to make a TCP
 *  connection to a remote server through a Nabto enabled device. You can
 *  use a standard TCP/IP socket to read and write data from and to the
 *  remote server.
 *
 *  The profile management API can be used to create use profiles for
 *  use in Nabto sessions.
